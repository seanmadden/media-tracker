media-tracker
=============
The goal of this is to track movies that I want to see and movies I have seen. At some point I might expand it to track more things, but for now it's simply media.

It will have a REST interface for interacting with the model, and maybe at some point I'll write an android app. Before that happens, I'll make sure the site also looks good on mobile devices.

Finally, I'd like to add imdb or some other movie DB interaction to get artwork/synopsis/etc.
